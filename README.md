## Overview
**FacesGCGAN** is a deep learning project that uses **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** for generating and analyzing facial images. This project leverages graph-based techniques to improve the quality and realism of generated faces and detect deepfakes.

For a detailed explanation of how GANs work, check out my article:

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FacesGCGAN.git
   cd FacesGCGAN
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. For Kaggle datasets, ensure you have a `kaggle.json` API key in place:

   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   files.upload()  # Upload kaggle.json

   !mkdir ~/.kaggle
   !cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the notebook** using Google Colab:

   [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexisvannson/Deepfake/blob/main/FacesGCGAN.ipynb)

2. **Steps within the notebook** include:
   - Dataset upload and preparation.
   - Model training and evaluation.
   - Deepfake detection analysis.
